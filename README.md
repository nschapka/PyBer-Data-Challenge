# PyBer-Data-Challenge

# Overview

An exploratory analysis was performed on data from a ride sharing app.

# Results

When analyzing the data, several trends become apparent.

While rural cities are the smallest market area by volume, they generate the most revenue per ride. As city density increases, the average fare decreases, and the average fare per driver dramatically decreases with increased city density.

Urban cities are the only place where drivers outnumber rides.  This could lead to problems with drivers not getting enough rides to justify continuing to drive with us.  

Total fares increase with city density, as most usage of the service comes from more urban areas.

# Summary

Three suggestions based on the data:

 - Roughly 20% of the population of the united states lives in rural areas, yet some weeks rural rides make up for less than 3% of total fares.  These rides also have the highest average fares.  It would be a good idea to promote the use of the service in rural areas, both to drivers and to riders.
 - Something should be done to increase the number of rides called in urban areas, where drivers currently outnumber riders.
 - If it is not possible to sufficiently increase the number of rides called in urban areas, it may be necessary to decrease the number of drivers.
